# ðŸ“š PC Shutdown Tool
After updating Windows on my old "potato laptop", I encountered an issue where every time I tried to shut down, it would automatically reboot ðŸ™‚. Despite trying numerous solutions, I couldn't resolve the problem.

One day, I discovered that using the command prompt (cmd) allowed my old laptop to shut down properly ðŸ¤ª.

Finally, I decided to build this desktop application to ensure proper shutdowns.

(P.S. I bought a new laptop afterward ðŸ™‚! Hopefully, I won't need to use this app again in the future.)
